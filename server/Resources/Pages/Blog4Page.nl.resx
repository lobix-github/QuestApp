    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>These days creativity, ideation, and idea management begin to gain more and more value.
Each day we must face many new challenges- it may be at the university, at school, at work, or even
at home. In all these places, we meet with various problems or needs, that we must solve as fast as
our legs could carry us. We are working multitasking and it’s always expected of us to be creative,
innovative, and highly productive. We must cooperate with a big amount of people despite we are all
so busy and scattered around the world. It all requires an adjustment and use of the latest
opportunities offered to us by technological development.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text0_2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>And then…The IT tools come to our aid.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unlimited options for working on the process</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text1_1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Due to IT tools, we’ve got an incredible possibility to work on cases in any part of the world,
only with help of a computer. We’re creating international teams so that we meet new people and

learn about their cultures. That gives us the possibility of exchanging experiences and knowledge,
even between experts in the remotest corners of the world. Not only the location ceases to be an
obstacle, but also time. We can work flexible hours. Working in Cloud enables us to develop our
ideas any time we’ve got one. It helps a lot because we’ve got unlimited options. And this, combined
with online knowledge resources, gives us amazing opportunities.</value>

  <data name="Text2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Expand the range of thinking through visualization</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text2_1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>IT tools help us with creating and developing ideas as well. With their help, we can visualize
at high levels of advancement and develop ideas by combining many tools at the same time. We’ve
got so many options and each of them is different, special. We can use ready templates, graphics,
videos, notes, sets of research notes, and many other graphic tools. We reach e.g. Miro or Canva and
by working with them, we start to expand the range of ideas beyond the current range of thinking.
This type of work gives us a new perspective on many known things. The use of IT tools allows us to
bring our visions to the documents and see them in a more substantial form. The process of creating
visualizations and working on their every detail makes us reflect deeper. We begin to question the
correctness of many aspects, their reality, and their applicability. Then we start to look for new
solutions, that will be maybe more suitable.</value>

  <data name="Text3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Personal experiences</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As I said we all have amazing opportunities to make of, but it depends on us if we will take
advantage of them. I’m happy that I decided to ride this new experience out. A short time ago, I had
got amazing opportunity to take part in a very interesting project. Our task was to find the best, most
innovative, and creative solution to the presented problem. The main thing was that during this
whole process we were encouraged to use many various IT tools, which we didn’t know so far. I had
a lot of doubts because at that moment I wasn’t into this ground. I hadn’t got sufficient knowledge
and I knew that I would have to learn everything from scratch. That scared me a little, but I didn&amp;#39;t
want to give up and this is how my journey with founding and exploring the way of using IT tools in
the analysis of innovative projects began.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I did not regret my decision. I’ve worked with my team on our project with a big investment.
It involved us a lot. I started to feel a thirst for knowledge and look for ideas in my free time on my
account. The discussion about the discoveries of each of us was thrilling. I don’t know how to
describe our brainstorms. I was really impressed that we can influence ourselves and generate so
many various examples of solutions.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It wasn’t always easy. First, we must learn how to use tools, which was at our command. You
know when we deal with something new it isn’t always all downhill. We made a lot of mistakes,
spoiled our project, and must rebuild it, but I think that this way of work teaches us the most. Every
mistake helps us to understand better the use of the particular tool. The inbuilt guides turned out to

be extremely helpful. We read the tips and learned new things in an extremely accessible way. They
were adapted to even the most novice users. We developed our skills and knowledge using the
method of small steps.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Even though the use of IT tools requires us to have access to the Internet and computer
equipment or mobile, which may be a limit or a problem in some situations, I think it’s well worth the
effort. In our team, we were from many different towns, to which everyone returned during part of
the week, and in that, we were not attached to the place. We used online calls, Miro, and Canvas
tools, so we were working in Cloud. That helps a lot. Any time we had an idea we were able to
discuss it with other members, and maybe inspire them. Sometimes our hardware and software were
stuck, and we must show our patience. Perhaps this would not be the case if we had used traditional
methods, but I suspect that in such a case we would spend much more time on corrections,
preparation for work, and collecting the necessary tools. IT tools offer us everything in one place.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I must also mention of one another weak point. The most important disadvantage was to
keep the team focused on the work. It takes a lot of effort to organize work well, during which
everyone is involved to a similar degree and performs the tasks entrusted to him. No face-to-face
contact handicapped management of it, but it may also occur in other cases. The use of IT tools can
also take place in direct contact. It is not closely related to this method of work. However, the work
using IT tools lets us in such situations to work also in adapted to us time and structure a plan of
work with due dates, tasks lists, and guidelines.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So, what would you say if I told you that not using IT tools will limit us and closes our perspectives?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>What do you think about it?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Text3_8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Please let me know, I can not wait to start a conversation about that.</value>
